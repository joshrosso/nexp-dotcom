# nexp-dotcom

This is the source code I use to synchronize my writing in Notion with
[joshrosso.com](https://joshrosso.com). It leverages
[joemi/notionapi](https://github.com/jomei/notionapi) and
[joshrosso/nexp](https://github.com/joshrosso/nexp).

This work is likely not usable beyond being examples for how `nexp` can be
leveraged to create a CMS out of your website.
